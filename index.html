The single biggest upgrade for an IRL Streamer that is directly sending their stream to twitch,kick,youtube,restream,etc is using an SRTLA relay, with an OBS instance at home actually doing the streaming.  
I recommend <a href="https://cloud.belabox.net">belabox cloud</a> if you have an OBS instance at home.  This will also allow connection bonding (using wifi and sim card in phone at same time), better compression for the same video quality via the HEVC codec and much quicker recovery when your stream will inevitably F.  It is as simple as signing up for github, sponsoring the belabox project for $10/month, and logging in and going to SRT(LA) relays at the top.  There is a media source to add in OBS and screenshots for the connection information for Moblin and/or IRL Pro.  Life changing!

To remotely control OBS, <a href="https://kit.rtirl.com/">RealTimeKit</a> is excellent.  <a href="https://rustdesk.com">Rustdesk</a> has a full remote desktop (and you can enable permanent password).  <a href="https://github.com/Kounex/obs_blade">OBS Blade</a> could be used to control OBS if you want to fiddle with WebSockets, port forwarding/VPN at home, and <a href="https://github.com/eerimoq/moblin">Moblin</a> could also do the OBS control work if you're getting that deep.  There are many additional ways to control your computer/stream, but these are tools I use.

If you want the features of belabox cloud + OBS and can't run OBS at home, there are many options for paid remote hosting for an instance, which will usually include an SRTLA relay (belabox cloud tech).  <a href="https://www.dallnett.com">TobbyTravel</a> has made a great comparison of prices and features of most of the providers at <a href="https://comparison.dallnett.com/">https://comparison.dallnett.com</a>
